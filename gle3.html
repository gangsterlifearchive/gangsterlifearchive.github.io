Black Gangster thanks D-money a second time for giving him a pistol, D-money responds with “"AYE NO PROBLEM GANGSTA NO PROBLEM! But uhhh- u wanna know what I was gonna tell u?" Black Gangster then responds with “Yeah, what?” D-money then proceeds to explain that he set the two of them up with a drug deal. Black Gangster needs money after escaping from prison, so he agrees to go  to the deal. Before hanging up the phone Black Gangster nervously asks “Holdup, what's da buyers name?” D-money then responds with “"Uhhhh, I think da dude said he was called Pete Daniels or sumin" This makes Black Gangster burst out laughing as he responds “LMAOO PETE DANIELS?!
