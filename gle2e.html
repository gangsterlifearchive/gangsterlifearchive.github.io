The sixth game and second epilogue in the series, Gangster Life: Story mode Remake EPISODE 2 EPILOGUE released on October 18th, 2023. Few patches have been released to which fixed minor issues. When this game first released, the first two games were not yet revamped. So the character of D-money didn’t exist prior to the game. Later an update patched Black Gangster’s relationship with d-money, in the first version, Black Gangster refers to D-Money as “that guy” Later updates would then update the story to make Black Gangster refer to D-Money as “D”, D-Money’s nickname.
<br><br>
This epilogue starts off with Black Gangster getting his signature full black suit back! Black Gangster says “Thank god I always keep a spare full black outfit in my backyard.” He then heads into town hoping to get a new gun after the cop took his. Shortly after Black Gangster arrives in town, he realizes he should call D-money for a gun (D-money is the drug dealer who got Black Gangster off the streets in the prologues.) Black Gangster calls D-money and tells him “Yo? D-money! We gotta talk, meet me at that one shady alleyway we used to sell at” Black Gangster then goes to the alley meeting D-money who tells him “AYE WADDUP GANGSTA! I AIN'T SEEN U SINCE U WENT TO DA PEN!” Black Gangster then responds with “I do NOT want to talk about that.” D-money then replies with “OKAY PLAYA I SEE U I SEE U! SO UHHHH, WHAT U WANNA BUY?” 
<br><br>
Black Gangster doesn’t have money at this point so he says “Buy? but what about Amon?” D-money then says “I heard U killed him GANGSTA!”. Black Gangster then says “So you should give me a 9mm pistol on da house!” This  conversation insinuates that at one point D-money and Amon were possible enemies. D-money responds to Black Gangster’s plea by saying “Oh you wanted a 9mm? das nothin! here u go GANGSTA!” Black Gangster then thanks D-money profusely and the two part ways.

Finally,  Black Gangster begins to dine at a pizza restaurant. He happily orders a pizza as he’s now a free man, this is where ‘EPISODE 2 EPILOGUE’ ends.
