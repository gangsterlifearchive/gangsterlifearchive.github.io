The episode begins with Black Gangster’s cellmate Dan complaining about it being hot in the cell. As a response Black Gangster says “ALRIGHT THAT'S ENOUGH I'M BUSTING OUTTA HERE!!!!” He then breaks out of the cell leaving his cellmate Dan behind. Black Gangster then finds his way back into the courtroom where he sees the judge who sentenced him. The judge sees Black Gangster and says “What are you doing back here? SECURITY!” Feeling angered by this Black Gangster then says “I SNUCK MY 9MM INTO JAIL!!! IMA KILL U!!!” He then shoots the judge, killing him instantly.

Shortly after this Black Gangster finds his way out of the prison and at the front of the building. He’s stopped by an armed guard who says to him “HEY BOY!” Black Gangster then responds with “I'M GONNA SHOOT YOU!” He then shoots and kills the armed guard and flees the prison. Black Gangster flees back to his cabin last seen in the second prologue, he arrives at his cabin and says to himself “Man, I never thought I'd make it back home. I best pack up and leave the-” He’s then interrupted by a familiar voice, the police officer from episode 1. The officer says “Drop the gun Gangster…” to Black Gangster. Black Gangster who had his back turned when he heard this had no choice but to comply with the officers commands. Black Gangster drops the gun then asks the officer “ Ain't you the one who arrested me?” The officer then replies with “Yup, and the one who guarded your court hearing…” This is a reference to his appearance in the epilogue to episode 1.

Having no choice Black Gangster asks the officer “Listen man this is AMERICA! Surely we can cut a deal?” The officer responds with “Y'know what, sure. You give me 100 grand and I'll forget all about you” Black Gangster then responds “Cmon man that's all the money I got ):” the cop then angrily responds “Shame I don't Give AF! I should shoot you for what you did to the Judge, hurry up and give me the 100 grand before I change my mind!” Black Gangster at this point does not have $100,000, but he lies to the officer anyways responding to him by saying “Fine, Moneys in the house, under the chimney.” The officer then walks into the house and Black Gangster laughs about how he fell for his lie, Black Gangster then runs away into his backyard forest. This is where ‘EPISODE 2’ ends.
