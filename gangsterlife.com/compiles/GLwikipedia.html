      <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span>The first episode in the Gangster Life series, </span><span>Gangster Life: Story Mode Episode 1</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;was released on July 13, 2018, the same day that the demo was released.

      <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c0">The second episode, &ldquo;Gangster Life: Story Mode Episode 2&rdquo; &nbsp;was released July 14, 2018. The game contains shooting mechanics, a mechanic that was introduced in the first episode and continued to be used throughout the series, an important part of the game. The story provided by coolcool44 is as follows: &ldquo;Black Gangster luck to come out from the prison and shop, he is now free.&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c0">The third episode in the series, &ldquo;Gangster Life: Story Mode Episode 3&rdquo; was released on the same day as the last episode, July 14, 2018, as the episodes were short, and coolcool44 could program the episodes quickly. The plot provided by coolcool44 is as follows: &ldquo;Black Gangster chase a airplane in Route 66 to robber the airplane and fly to Las Vegas.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s also the first time in the entire canon series that the protagonist, Black Gangster speaks.

      <h2 class="c17" id="h.jngqbxrrkig5"><span class="c13 c18">Release History &amp; Reception</span></h2>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c0">The games were released on a &quot;two-a-day&quot; schedule, over the course of 3 days. The games were presumably getting released as they were getting developed. Early feedback is practically non-existent, as coolcool44&#39;s following at the time was small. Up to his hiatus, coolcool44 always would respond to comments when they were left on the series, sometimes in his first language, Polish, but he would also respond to comments in English. Gangster Life: Story Mode was written and released entirely in english. No translations are available for the Gangster Life: Story Mode series. The language barrier isn&#39;t a problem however, as apart from the instructions and credits, there&#39;s only one line in the series. In September 2023, the Gangster Life series has found a new following, with a spike in views and comments on the series since then. In 2023, a devoted fan of the Gangster Life series took it upon themselves to completely remake and rewrite the series from scratch, to give it a more deep and emotional story.</span></p>
      <h1 class="c17" id="h.rcz54ldyek85"><span class="c11">Gangster Life: Story Mode Remakes </span></h1>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c9 c10">Gangster Life: Story Mode Remakes are a point-and-click, action adventure video game series developed and published by GangsterLifeLoverr4, a developer and avid Gangster Life fan. The pseudonym GangsterLifeLoverr4 is a reference to the original Gangster Life: Story Mode series, which GangsterLifeLoverr4 is an avid fan of. Similar to the original series, the games are being published on Scratch</span><span class="c4">. There are 11 games in the Gangster Life Remake series. Thoughts on the black community?</span></p>
      <h2 class="c17" id="h.gvz4b6jr8gpd"><span class="c13">Release History &amp; Plot</span></h2>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Due to the remake series being more story based, there is much more plot to them compared to coolcool44&rsquo;s original series. The remake series takes place &ldquo;in a different universe&rdquo; than coolcool44&rsquo;s series. As of 1/8/2024, the games are still being updated.</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c0">The first game in the Gangster Life Remake series &ldquo;Gangster Life: Story mode Remake Prologue PART 1&rdquo; was released on September 20th, 2023. It was made as a prologue to the first Episode. </span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Originally the game was simply a sprite test, titled &ldquo;Gangster Life Wambo Lovin Experiment&rdquo; including simply the Black Gangster sprite exclaiming, &quot;DAMN, I LOVE MY WAMBO [sic]&quot; before the sprite would get distorted. Later changes would completely revamp the project, turning it into an entirely new game.</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c0">The prologue starts off in a Mcdonald&#39;s which Black Gangster had been living in for the past 5 years, while Black Gangster is begging the employees for a free burger a man greets him. The man introduces himself as D-money, D-money then asks Black Gangster if he would like to be his backup at a drug deal he&rsquo;s doing, he says that it&rsquo;ll take place in an alleyway at around midnight. Black Gangster asks what the pay is and D-money says they&rsquo;ll make $25,000 between each of them. Black Gangster takes this deal and in response D-money hands him a Colt M1911 pistol.</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Black Gangster shows up to the alleyway at midnight but doesn&rsquo;t see anybody, just then D-money shows up with the buyer Amon Schwartz. D-money apologizes for being late and introduces Black Gangster to Amon. Amon in response says, &ldquo;HERE&rsquo;S THE MONEY, JUST GIMME THE WEED!&rdquo; D-money then asks to see the money first, Amon shows it and the two do the deal. After getting the marijuana, Amon asks who this &ldquo;Bald loser&rdquo; (Black Gangster) is. Black Gangster in response threatens him with his gun. Amon runs off scared after this. The game ends with Black Gangster going back to the Mcdonald&rsquo;s packing up getting ready to buy a house. This is where &lsquo;Prologue PART 1&rsquo; ends.</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c0">The second game in the Gangster Life Remake series &ldquo;Gangster Life: Story mode Remake Prologue PART 2&rdquo; was released on September 27th, 2023. It was the second part to the previous prologue and the final prologue in the series. Similar to the first prologue, it was completely revamped. The original name of this game was Gangster Life: Story mode Demo Remake. Shortly after the release of Gangster Life: Story mode Remake EPISODE 2 EPILOGUE &nbsp;the game was completely revamped into the game we have today.</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Similar to the first prologue, the original project was much different than the final one. When the game was first published, it was simply a retexture of the Gangster Life: Story Mode demo, made by coolcool44. The background was solid white, and in place of where all the buildings were, there was one single mcdonalds. Black Gangster&#39;s signature red car was also present. This game was revamped around the same time as the first prologue being revamped.</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c0">The prologue begins with Black Gangster shouting at the employees, telling them things like, &ldquo;GUESS WHO AIN&rsquo;T GOTTA BEG FOR A FREE BURGER NO MORE?!?!?!&rdquo; Shortly after yelling at the employees, Black Gangster leaves the Mcdonald&rsquo;s and goes onto Main Street. Black Gangster (Not knowing how to legally buy a house) then calls D-Money for help. D-Money Doesn&rsquo;t answer the phone, which leaves Black Gangster all alone. Black Gangster decides that he&rsquo;ll figure it all out on his own, he starts off by heading to a real estate office for a house.</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span>Shortly after arriving at the real estate office, Black Gangster meets the real estate agent. His name is Calvrett and he asks Black Gangster what his budget is. Black Gangster, only having $25,000 from the drug deal last game, decides that his budget is $20,000. Calvrett then says, &ldquo;I got something for you, it&rsquo;s not so luxurious but it suits a man like you.&rdquo; Black Gangster then tells </span><span>Calvrett</span><span>, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t need any utilities or any of that.&rdquo; Calvrett replies with, &ldquo;You sure? How you gonna clean yourself?&rdquo; Black Gangster feeling insulted screams, &ldquo;NONE OF </span><span>YO BUSINESS</span><span class="c0">, NOW JUST GIMME DA ADDRESS!&rdquo; Feeling threatened Calvrett gives him the address, Black Gangster then goes to the house to check it out.</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span>After arriving at the house Black Gangster sees that it&rsquo;s a cabin, he likes this but he comes to the conclusion that he&rsquo;ll need a car. Black Gangster goes to a local car dealership where to his anger, he sees Calvrett working there as well. Calvrett gets scared because of the last encounter the two had. Black Gangster decided to put their differences aside so he can buy a car. Calvrett briefly does this by asking him which car he wants. Black Gangster goes for a small red one that costs $4,500. Suspicious of this Black Gangster asks why it&rsquo;s so cheap, Calvrett tells him, &ldquo;We&#39;ve just been trying to get rid of it.&rdquo; Black Gangster then decides to buy the car. Calvrett asks Black Gangster &ldquo;You </span><span>payin</span><span class="c0">&#39; cash right?&rdquo; This offends Black Gangster and again, the two start arguing. Calvrett in a panicked state tells Black Gangster that he can fill out the papers at the DMV across the street. Black Gangster then leaves the dealership.</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span>Black Gangster enters the DMV ready to get his license renewed, when he sees Calvrett again. Calvrett at this point is terrified, Black Gangster is a man who ran out of patience the day he went bankrupt. But, Black Gangster keeps his cool. He screams at </span><span>Calvrett</span><span class="c0">, &ldquo;Y&#39;KNOW WHAT MAN! FORGET IT GIVE ME MY DRIVERS LICENSE SO I NEVER HAVE TO SEE YOU AGAIN!!!&rdquo; After this he goes back to his cabin with his brand new car. He says, &ldquo;Guess I&#39;ll wait here for awhile, Might head to that corn palace!&rdquo; After Black Gangster says this, &lsquo;Prologue PART 2&rsquo; ends.</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c0">The third game and first official episode in the Gangster Life Remake series, &ldquo;Gangster Life: Story mode Remake EPISODE 1&rdquo; the first episode in the remake series released on September 30th, 2023. It was released as a sequel to the first two prologues. The game was updated many times since its release, mostly minor bugfix updates. Major updates include entirely new backgrounds, and updated scripts.</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c0">The episode begins in front of the corn palace, Black Gangster spots Amon Schwartz (The buyer from the Prologue PART 1) sitting on the corn palace sign. Amon sees Black Gangster and &nbsp;says to him, &nbsp;&ldquo;HEY U DA DUDE WHO SOLD ME DA DOPE! DAT DOPE WAS GARBAGE!! IMA KILL U&rdquo; Black Gangster feels threatened by this, so he shoots Amon, killing him. A police officer then comes out of nowhere and tells Black Gangster that he&rsquo;ll arrest him. Black Gangster doesn&rsquo;t want to be arrested, so he says he didn&rsquo;t do anything. The police officer, however, saw Black Gangster shoot Amon, so he gets arrested. The cop who arrests Black Gangster &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;becomes the main antagonist after this.

      <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;The sixth game and second epilogue in the series, Gangster Life: Story mode Remake EPISODE 2 EPILOGUE released on October 18th, 2023. Few patches have been released to which fixed minor issues. When this game first released, the first two games were not yet revamped. So the character of D-money didn&rsquo;t exist prior to the game. Later an update patched Black Gangster&rsquo;s relationship with d-money, in the first version, Black Gangster refers to D-Money as &ldquo;that guy&rdquo; Later updates would then update the story to make Black Gangster refer to D-Money as &ldquo;D&rdquo;, D-Money&rsquo;s nickname.</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span>This epilogue starts off with Black Gangster getting his signature full black suit back! Black Gangster says &ldquo;Thank god I always keep a spare full black outfit in my backyard.&rdquo; He then heads into town hoping to get a new gun after the cop </span><span>took</span><span>&nbsp;his. Shortly after Black Gangster arrives in town, he realizes he should call D-money for a gun (D-money is the drug dealer who got Black Gangster off the streets in the prologues.) Black Gangster calls D-money and tells him &ldquo;Yo? D-money! We gotta talk, meet me at that one shady alleyway we used to sell at&rdquo; Black </span><span>Gangster then</span><span>&nbsp;goes to the alley meeting D-money who tells him &ldquo;AYE </span><span>WADDUP</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;GANGSTA! I AIN&#39;T SEEN U SINCE U WENT TO DA PEN!&rdquo; Black Gangster then responds with &ldquo;I do NOT want to talk about that.&rdquo; D-money then replies with &ldquo;OKAY PLAYA I SEE U I SEE U! SO UHHHH, WHAT U WANNA BUY?&rdquo; </span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span>Black Gangster doesn&rsquo;t have money at this point so he says &ldquo;Buy? but what about Amon?&rdquo; D-money then says &ldquo;I heard U killed him GANGSTA!&rdquo;. Black Gangster then says &ldquo;So you should give me a 9mm pistol </span><span>on da</span><span>&nbsp;house!&rdquo; This &nbsp;conversation insinuates that at one point D-money and Amon were possible enemies. D-money responds to Black Gangster&rsquo;s plea by saying &ldquo;Oh you wanted a 9mm? das </span><span>nothin</span><span class="c0">! here u go GANGSTA!&rdquo; Black Gangster then thanks D-money profusely and the two part ways. </span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>

Shortly after its release, GangsterLifeLoverr4 was permanently banned. Here are a few details that can be shared about the game. It featured a major choice that resulted in the game being able to go in two entirely different directions. One being a revenge ending and the other being a full circle ending. After the credits of the game played, a post credit bonus scene showing D-money would appear, text in the background said &ldquo;D-money returns.&rdquo; A few hours later GangsterLifeLoverr4 made an announcement of a prequel game series titled, &ldquo;D-money&rsquo;s days&rdquo;. The game was going to be set before the events of the Gangster Life Remake and it would have told the story of how D-money came to be the massive drug kingpin we see in the remakes.</span></p>

      <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c0">The creator of the Remake series GangsterLifeLoverr4 was permanently banned from Scratch just 4 days after the release of his final episode. Just a few days before his ban he publicly revealed the development of D- moneys days, a prequel series to his Gangster Life Remakes. He was banned due to fans posting his projects to promotion studios, a moderator named PickledStudio deemed the entire series as too violent and decided to report Gangster Life: Story mode Remake Prologue PART 1. Six hours after this report was sent, the entire account along with all of the projects made under it were deleted. This occurred at 6:11 PM CST on the night of December 18th, 2023.</span></p>

      <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c0">After his ban GangsterLifeLoverr4 quickly made another account, it went under the alias GangstaLifeLoverr4, which is a clear reference to his original account. He published only one project, The Fate of GangsterLifeLoverr4.</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span>The Fate of GangsterLifeLoverr4 begins with Black Gangster dead, laying on a grave. On the grave there is text, it reads &ldquo;Here Lies GangsterLifeLoverr4 along with him, his Gangster Life Remakes </span><span>aswell</span><span class="c0">&rdquo; A quote on his grave also says &ldquo;Death is a short ride&rdquo;. After this funeral, the game transitions with a sprite of GangsterLifeLoverr4 standing on the Main street road from his Gangster Life series. He goes on to explain the history of his account and how he discovered the series of Gangster Life. He goes on to explain how he&rsquo;s grateful that he got to finish his original remake series before being banned. He ends his explanation by saying, &ldquo;thanks to scratch user PickledStudio, all of you Gangster Life fans won&#39;t be getting the D- moneys days prequel that was promised&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c0">GangsterLifeLoverr4 then says goodbye and the game ends on a screen that says, &ldquo;I am sorry to anybody who was looking forward to the D-money&rsquo;s days series. But don&rsquo;t blame me. Blame&hellip;&rdquo; the background then switches to a black background with one username, &lsquo;&ldquo;PickledStudio &#39;&#39;.&rsquo; This is the end of GangsterLifeLoverr4&rsquo;s scratch career.</span></p>

      <p class="c2"><span class="c0">GangsterLifeLoverr4 had a very sad end, he was banned by an automated moderation which was used by Scratch. It&rsquo;s very sad that they never even bothered to look at his series and see the impact that it had on people. A good associate of GangsterLifeLoverr4&rsquo;s (Pastor88) was saddened by the sudden ban of GangsterLifeLoverr4, after the ban pastor88 updated his bio to include a farewell to GangsterLifeLoverr4. It says, &ldquo;RIP GangstaLifeLoverr4 the hood lost a real one.&rdquo; This is all the information currently available on GangsterLifeLoverr4 as of 1/5/2024.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
