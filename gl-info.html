<br>
this is a document written about coolcool's original series along with gangsterliveloverr4's remake series. it is where all the info on this website comes from. we were going to put it on wikipedia but they didn't like it so it's here.
<br>it has info on every single one of the episodes up to episode 5, the finale, as it was only up for four days before gangsterliveloverr4's scratch page got removed, but everything else was on there with intentionally great detail, up to the latest updates of each episode.
<br><br>important to note that the archives i made of the projects are from november 1st 2023, so they're outdated, and i don't even have anything after episode 3. <a href="other\costume1.png">i don't know where to put this but here's black gangster's sprite.</a>
