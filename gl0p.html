<br>The first game in the Gangster Life Remake series “Gangster Life: Story mode Remake Prologue PART 1” was released on September 20th, 2023. It was made as a prologue to the first Episode. 
<br><br>
Originally the game was simply a sprite test, titled “Gangster Life Wambo Lovin Experiment” including simply the Black Gangster sprite exclaiming, "DAMN, I LOVE MY WAMBO [sic]" before the sprite would get distorted. Later changes would completely revamp the project, turning it into an entirely new game.
<br><br>
The prologue starts off in a Mcdonald's which Black Gangster had been living in for the past 5 years, while Black Gangster is begging the employees for a free burger a man greets him. The man introduces himself as D-money, D-money then asks Black Gangster if he would like to be his backup at a drug deal he’s doing, he says that it’ll take place in an alleyway at around midnight. Black Gangster asks what the pay is and D-money says they’ll make $25,000 between each of them. Black Gangster takes this deal and in response D-money hands him a Colt M1911 pistol.
<br><br>
Black Gangster shows up to the alleyway at midnight but doesn’t see anybody, just then D-money shows up with the buyer Amon Schwartz. D-money apologizes for being late and introduces Black Gangster to Amon. Amon in response says, “HERE’S THE MONEY, JUST GIMME THE WEED!” D-money then asks to see the money first, Amon shows it and the two do the deal. After getting the marijuana, Amon asks who this “Bald loser” (Black Gangster) is. Black Gangster in response threatens him with his gun. Amon runs off scared after this. The game ends with Black Gangster going back to the Mcdonald’s packing up getting ready to buy a house. This is where ‘Prologue PART 1’ ends.
