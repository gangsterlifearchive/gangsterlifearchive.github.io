<br><b style="color:yellow;">This is a remake of the original remake made 1/24/2024. It has been upgraded substantially from the original remake from november.</b> <br><br>

The eighth game and third epilogue in the series, Gangster Life: Story mode Remake EPISODE 3 EPILOGUE was released on November 6th, 2023. It was released just five days after the third episode, this is one of the shortest breaks in between two Gangster Life Remake titles.
<br>

The epilogue begins with Black Gangster, still in shock because of what happened to D-money. Black Gangster says to himself “THEY GOT D- THEY SHOT EM!” Although he got shot, the last time Black Gangster saw D-money he was still alive. Black Gangster says to himself “He could still be alive tho.” Black Gangster is still trespassing on this farm so he says to himself “I gotta get back to town before this farmer sees me.” he then says to himself “I gotta go to the hospital, maybe D's there…” Black Gangster then heads back into town.
<br><br>

In town Black Gangster realizes he has a manhunt going for him, so he goes to buy a disguise at his local dollar general. After he purchases his disguise he says “Damn, this costume reminds me of prison.” His costume is a fully red bodysuit, this is similar to his prison suit except rather than being orange, it’s red. 
<br><br>

Black Gangster arrives at the local hospital and says to himself “Alright Ima have to lie and say that I'm d's family” He then walks inside. Once inside he is greeted by Calvrett, (The man from Prologue PART 2 with multiple jobs.) Calvrett doesn’t notice it’s Black Gangster at first so he greets him by saying “Hey, did you schedule a-” he then realizes it’s him and says “NO NOT YOU AGAIN!!” Black Gangster is shocked by Calvrett having so many jobs, he asks Calvrett “HOW- THE HELL- DO YOU HAVE 4 JOBS??” Calvrett then responds by saying “Man it's like I told you a few days ago, a big boys gotta eat!”

<br><br>

Black Gangster brushes this off by saying “Man whatever,” He then takes a pause before asking “Wait- How'd u recognize me?” Calvrett then responds to the question by saying "It's kinda obvious... also ain't you wanted for murder and drug trafficking?” Black Gangster, realizing that Calvrett knows everything, begs him by saying “Uhhh, look man, please don't tell nobody bout this.” Calvrett responds to his plea by saying “I won’t” Calvrett then gives Black Gangster a face mask to help cover up his identity. Black Gangster says thanks, he then asks Calvrett “anyways is there a patient D-money?” Calvrett responds to this by saying “Yeah there is, y'all related?” Black Gangster then responds “uhhh- I'm his half uncle, can I see him?” This is an obvious lie but he has to do whatever he can to see D. Calvrett responds to this by saying “Of course, he's in the room 3 halls down.” Black Gangster then goes into the room. 

<br><br>
In the hospital room Black Gangster sees D-money hooked up to machines, one of them being a heart rate monitor. Black Gangster immediately screams, “OH NAW- D!!!” Black Gangster then asks D, “D, can you- Can U hear me?” D-money then regains consciousness and can barely speak. He asks Black Gangster, “ A- Are--- u...-- Real?” Black Gangster then responds, “YEAH D!!! IT'S ME!” D-money then tells him, “ U- Gotta... g-et- outt--a here-- Gangsta…” At this point D-money can hardly speak. Black Gangster responds by saying, “But if u survive this... They're gonna take u to PRISON D!!” D-money then tells Black Gangster, “ Juss- go... I- Been-- t-to... prison- b-efore.” Black Gangster then tells D-money, “I ain't leaving D…” D-money responds, “T--hank u…” The heart monitor then flat lines and D-money dies.

<br><br>
 Black Gangster immediately goes into a state of denial before finally realizing he’s dead. He makes a promise to D, he says, “D I promise u, Ima find the people who did this to u... And I'll avenge your death.” The last thing he says to the lifeless D-money is, “You won't be forgotten…” He then leaves the room and returns to the town's local Main street. He says to himself “I'm gonna find that damn cop and KILL HIM!” The epilogue then ends.
