<br>The second game in the Gangster Life Remake series “Gangster Life: Story mode Remake Prologue PART 2” was released on September 27th, 2023. It was the second part to the previous prologue and the final prologue in the series. Similar to the first prologue, it was completely revamped. The original name of this game was Gangster Life: Story mode Demo Remake. Shortly after the release of Gangster Life: Story mode Remake EPISODE 2 EPILOGUE  the game was completely revamped into the game we have today.
<br><br>
Similar to the first prologue, the original project was much different than the final one. When the game was first published, it was simply a retexture of the Gangster Life: Story Mode demo, made by coolcool44. The background was solid white, and in place of where all the buildings were, there was one single mcdonalds. Black Gangster's signature red car was also present. This game was revamped around the same time as the first prologue being revamped.
<br><br>

The prologue begins with Black Gangster shouting at the employees, telling them things like, “GUESS WHO AIN’T GOTTA BEG FOR A FREE BURGER NO MORE?!?!?!” Shortly after yelling at the employees, Black Gangster leaves the Mcdonald’s and goes onto Main Street. Black Gangster (Not knowing how to legally buy a house) then calls D-Money for help. D-Money Doesn’t answer the phone, which leaves Black Gangster all alone. Black Gangster decides that he’ll figure it all out on his own, he starts off by heading to a real estate office for a house.
<br><br>

Shortly after arriving at the real estate office, Black Gangster meets the real estate agent. His name is Calvrett and he asks Black Gangster what his budget is. Black Gangster, only having $25,000 from the drug deal last game, decides that his budget is $20,000. Calvrett then says, “I got something for you, it’s not so luxurious but it suits a man like you.” Black Gangster then tells Calvrett, “I won’t need any utilities or any of that.” Calvrett replies with, “You sure? How you gonna clean yourself?” Black Gangster feeling insulted screams, “NONE OF YO BUSINESS, NOW JUST GIMME DA ADDRESS!” Feeling threatened Calvrett gives him the address, Black Gangster then goes to the house to check it out.
<br><br>

After arriving at the house Black Gangster sees that it’s a cabin, he likes this but he comes to the conclusion that he’ll need a car. Black Gangster goes to a local car dealership where to his anger, he sees Calvrett working there as well. Calvrett gets scared because of the last encounter the two had. Black Gangster decided to put their differences aside so he can buy a car. Calvrett briefly does this by asking him which car he wants. Black Gangster goes for a small red one that costs $4,500. Suspicious of this Black Gangster asks why it’s so cheap, Calvrett tells him, “We've just been trying to get rid of it.” Black Gangster then decides to buy the car. Calvrett asks Black Gangster “You payin' cash right?” This offends Black Gangster and again, the two start arguing. Calvrett in a panicked state tells Black Gangster that he can fill out the papers at the DMV across the street. Black Gangster then leaves the dealership.
<br><br>

Black Gangster enters the DMV ready to get his license renewed, when he sees Calvrett again. Calvrett at this point is terrified, Black Gangster is a man who ran out of patience the day he went bankrupt. But, Black Gangster keeps his cool. He screams at Calvrett, “Y'KNOW WHAT MAN! FORGET IT GIVE ME MY DRIVERS LICENSE SO I NEVER HAVE TO SEE YOU AGAIN!!!” After this he goes back to his cabin with his brand new car. He says, “Guess I'll wait here for awhile, Might head to that corn palace!” After Black Gangster says this, ‘Prologue PART 2’ ends.
